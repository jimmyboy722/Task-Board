# Task Board 
Are you one of those people who'd forget their head if it wasn't attached to them? Well, so am I. Good thing we have this handy-dandy Task Board.
## What it does
This task board makes organizing your web-dev project a breeze. Benjamin Franklin once said, "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."
Truer words, right? Well this task board helps do just that and makes staying on top of all your app projects a lot easier.
### Features
- Add individual tasks to independently to the task board including a title, a due date, and description.
- Manage those tasks' state of progress by dragging them into "Not Yet Started", "In Progress", or "Completed" task columns bassed on necessity.
- Color coded task status based on due dates (red for overdue and yellow for nearing due date).
- The tasks's progress state is updated accordingly and ,when saved, will stay in the new column even after your browser is refreshed.
- If you wish to delete a task, it is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing
